# What is Harmonize?

**Harmonize** is a joint initiative of **Czech and Polish Literary Bibliography**, both being long-term existing bibliographical infrastructures operating within the National Academies of Sciences. The aim of the service is to collect, merge and provide one interface to present multilingual bibliographical metadata for literary studies stored in MARC21 format. Currently, available collections are the **Czech Literary Bibliography**, the **Polish Literary Bibliography**, and the literary content extracted from the **National Library of Finland**. The Harmonize data are presented within the VuFind discovery system. Within the **Harmonize** project framework, various software updates of VuFind adopted to the presentation of the literary bibliographical data were developed.
